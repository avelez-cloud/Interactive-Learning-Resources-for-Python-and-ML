But Python also uses a different way to tell users about arguments being optional. Have a look at the documentation of sorted() by typing help(sorted) in the IPython Shell. You'll see that sorted() takes three arguments: iterable, key and reverse. Key equals none which means that if you don't specify the key argument, it will be None. reverse=False means that if you don't specify the reverse argument, it will be False. In this exercise, you'll only have to specify iterable and reverse, not key. The first input you pass to sorted() will be matched to the iterable argument, but what about the second input? To tell Python you want to specify reverse without changing anything about key, you can use =:\n",

    "## Chapter 8: Packages\n",
    "By now the power of Python functions and methods has been observed as they allow us to use code snippets from different programs to solve new problems. However, adding all the Python functions and methods available in the same Python distribution would be a mess. There would be lots and lots of code that you would never use. Also, code maintenance would be really problematic. This is were packages come into play. You can think of packages as a directory of Python scripts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- pkg/\n",
    "    mod1.py\n",
    "    mod2.py\n",

There are thousands of Python packages available from the internet. Among them are packages for data science such as numpy (used to efficiently work with arrays), matplotlib (used for data visualization), and scikit-learn (used for machine learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all of these packages are available in Python by default. To use Python packages, you'll first have to install them on your own system and then, put code in your script to tell Python that you want to use these packages. To execute the installing, you'll have to use pip, a package maintenance system for Python. If you go to the following URL: \n",

    "\n",
    "you can download the file get-pip.py. Next, you go to the terminal and execute \"python3 get-pip.py\" and you'll be able to use pip and install the Python packages of your choosing. Suppose you want to install the numpy package which will be discussed in the next section, you'll type \"python3 pip3 install numpy\" and you'll be able to use the numpy package in your Python scripts. However, before you use an install Python package, you should import the package, or the specific module of the package you're going to be using. This is done through the import statement. To import the entire numpy package, you can write \"import numpy\" on your code. Then, to refer to a function from a package you will use the dot (.) notation after writing the name of the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",

    "\n",
    "Using the package name and (.) notation as a prefix for each function that you call from a package can be pretty tiring. However, you can also import the package and refer to it with a different name by extending the import statement as follows: import numpy as np. Now, instead of \"numpy.array()\" you'll have to use np.array to use numpy's array function.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also cases were you only need one specific function of the package. Python allows you to make this explicit in your code. Suppose we only wanted to use the array function from the numpy package. Then, the import statement can be changed from \"import numpy\" to \"from numpy import array\". This \"from import\" version to use specific parts of a package can be useful to limit the amount of coding, but you're also loosing some of the context. You loose context because when you import a specific function, you won't have to use the dot (.) notation specifying the package in which the function is found for a function call. As a result, a person reviewing the code might forget that the array function being used is a specific numpy function."

For the numpy arrays from previous sections this is a simple task because they didn't contain much data. However, as a data scientist you'll be working with thousands, if not millions or billions of numbers.\n",

In that case, you'll probably end up with a 2D numpy array called np_city with 5000 rows corresponding to the 5000 people and two columns corresponding to height and weight respectively. However, the individual numbers won't give you any insights into the data. True insights on the data can only be obtained through summary statistics about the data. The numpy package is also useful in this case providing functions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- np.mean(np_city[:, 0]): Gets average height of 5000 people.\n",
    "- np.median(np_city[:, 0): Gets height of middle person if you sort heights from small to tall.\n",
    "- np.corrcoef(np_city[:,0], np_city[:,1]): Gets Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients in matrix form which, in this case, specifies the correlation between height and weight. The correlation coefficient is a measure of the direction and strength of a linear relationship among variables. Correlation coefficients range from -1 to +1 where: -1 means perfect negative relationship, 0 means no relationship, and +1 means perfect positive relationship.\n",

    "5. Do the same for the other players. Print out their median height. Replace None with the correct code."
